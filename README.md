## Description:
This project is developed based on the GeleceÄŸi Yazanlar Unity Bootcamp training, with additional features implemented by me after the bootcamp. The game is a skill-based adventure where the player continuously jumps upwards using platforms.

## Game Features:
#### Start Screen and Menu:
The start screen that appears when the game begins provides users with the opportunity to start the game, view high scores, and adjust game settings.
#### Difficulty Levels and Settings:
There is a special "Settings" page to adjust difficulty levels within the game. Users can set the difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) and the arrangement of platform exits (random, right-left). Additionally, they can toggle the background music on and off.
#### Score and Recording System:
The game includes a score table that records users' highest scores. Difficulty levels, platform arrangements, and other settings are saved using PlayerPrefs, remembering the user's preferences.
### In-Game Features:
Players can increase their scores by collecting gold on platforms, earn big rewards with gold chests, and protect themselves from lethal platforms using shields.
Collecting rockets provides a fast ascent for a limited time, giving players an advantage.
#### Object Pooling and Visual Design:
Platform and background visuals are efficiently managed using the Object Pooling method to enhance performance.

#### Game Difficulty and Speed:
As the game progresses, platform difficulty levels and the camera's ascent speed increase, providing players with a continuous challenge.
### Gameplay:
Players move upwards between platforms after the start screen. They can navigate right or left with buttons in the bottom right corner and control jumping movements with a special joystick. Players can earn points by collecting gold, protect themselves from lethal platforms with shields, and achieve a rapid ascent with rockets.

## Features Added After Bootcamp:

### Shield Feature:
 Players can collect shields to protect themselves from lethal platforms, and they can carry a maximum of 3 shields.
### Rocket Feature:
 Players can collect rockets to achieve a rapid ascent for a specific duration.
### Future Platform Positioning Button:
 Users can utilize a special button to determine the positioning of future platforms.
Various Animations and Sound Effects: Additional animations and sound effects I incorporated enhance the overall gaming experience.
